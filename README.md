Welcome to our group project, where we begin an interesting quest to uncover narratives from two important data sets related to COVID-19 vaccination in Ottawa. In the first dataset, we delved into statistics on COVID vaccination among people of different age groups, aiming to understand the distribution of different age groups and uncover the stories within them. Meanwhile, our second dataset focuses on the types of vaccinations people receive and explores potential relationships between this dataset and the previous one. By analyzing these datasets, we aim to uncover the stories behind the numbers and explore correlations between age groups and vaccine preferences. Our project aims not only to analyze statistics, but also to uncover the human stories and social implications behind these vaccination trends, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of Ottawa's vaccination journey.

The group members are WeiHao Zhang(John), Ethan Murphy-Spack, and Liam Horner. It is the final project for the MPAD2003A course in Carleton University.
